# Project: Business Intelligence - PENSE IBGE
This is a small project for personal study, using research data from the PENSE - IBGE

## What is the PENSE ?

It provides estimates of the total population of Brazilian Municipalities and Federation Units, with a reference date of July 1, for the current calendar year.

IBGE has released state and municipal population estimates since 1975. As of 1992, it began to publish them in the Federal Official Gazette, in compliance with Art. 102 of Law no. 8,443, dated 07/16/1992, for the purposes provided for in Section VI of Article 1 of the said law. In 2013, Complementary Law no. 143, dated 07/17/2013, establishing which competent entity of the federal executive power will publish, in the Official Gazette, by August 31 of each year, the list of the populations of the Municipalities, and by December 31, the list of populations of the States and the Federal District. Municipal populations, it should be noted, are the most important input used by the Federal Court of Accounts - TCU for the distribution of the State and Federal District Participation Fund - FPE and the Municipality Participation Fund - FPM.

Population estimates published annually are calculated using the mathematical method developed in 1972 by João Lira Madeira and Celso Cardoso da Silva Simões, called AiBi. This method uses as basic inputs the populations obtained from the Population Projections for Brazil and the most recent Federation Units, as well as the population growth of each Municipality in the last decade, outlined by the respective populations recorded in the last two Demographic Censuses carried out. These census populations, which serve as the basis for calculating the trend of population growth in the Municipalities, can be adjusted in line with the population adjustments adopted in the Population Projections for Brazil and the Federation Units.

In addition to the aforementioned basic inputs, the municipal population estimates incorporate, every year, updates to the country's political-administrative division that reflect, in turn, the changes in the territorial limits of the Municipalities that occurred after the last Demographic Census. Since the sum of the populations of the Municipalities results in the total population of the respective Federation Unit, any differences between the total population of a Federation Unit obtained from Population Estimates and that obtained from Population Projections are the result of updating the political division -administrative occurred after the base year of the beginning of the projections (and, therefore, not considered in the Population Projections of the Federation Units).

 ## Objective
 
 I used the file made available with the government with the students answers, and separated some questions to see the incidence based on some metrics, example (age, color, public or private school).
 
 ## How to run in your computer
 
 For the scripts and get the data, just import the excel file located at [Data](https://github.com/brenocezardias/Projeto-BI/tree/master/Data) by the SQL Server importer, run the script for creating the tables of the relational and dimensional models, located at [SQL](https://github.com/brenocezardias/Projeto-BI/tree/master/SQL). Connect that bank to Power BI and create dashboards!
 
 ## Comments
 
 The dashboards I created for my project are in [dashboards](https://github.com/brenocezardias/Projeto-BI/tree/master/Dashboards) if you want to analyze.
 
I also made available a Power Point with a quick presentation of some data that I found. It's at [Presentation](https://github.com/brenocezardias/Projeto-BI/tree/master/Apresenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o)
 
 Thank you for your time !
